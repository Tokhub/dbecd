  <p>  <h2>Data set description </h2></p>
  The data of eNyckeln was provided through the "End-use metering campaign in 400 households in Sweden, assessment of the potential electricity savings" project which is owned by Swedish energy Agancy. 
In this program measurements and surveys of commercial buildings (STIL2), energy for water consumption in households and energy consumption in industry are carried out.
It includes energy statistics for apartment buildings, commercial premises and public buildings.
This surey was done through a web based portal. Through it  propertiy owners could report their energy consumption and could compare their usage level with other similar buildings.
