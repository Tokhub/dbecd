<p><h2>Access to the dataset</h2> </p>
<p> The access to the dataset is possible through  <a href="http://www.vs.inf.ethz.ch/res/show.html?what=eco-data"> this link </a>. To get the required credentials for downloading the dataset, person is asked to send contact information and a short description on what they plan to do with the data via e-mail.  </p>

  <p>  <h2>Data set description</h2> </p>
  <p> The ECO data set contains smart meter data (at 1 Hz) from 6 households in Switzerland collected over a period of 8 months. It further contains plug data of 6 to 10 plugs per household (also measured at 1 Hz) and information about the occupancy of people in the house (indicated through a tablet PC that was located next to the entrance door). It is currently being used by >40 researchers 
 </p>
 <p> <h2>Dataset structure </h2>  </p>
 <p>The UMass smart* data set includes several compressed .tar files for each home. And each one of them contains several csv-Excel files for every day and a Format file describing the attributes name.  </p>
  
  <p> <h2>Attributes</h2> </p>
  <p> Timestamp (Unix) </p>
  <p> Voltage	</p>
  <p>Current</p>
<p>Phase shift	</p>
<p>Inside Temperature and outside Temperature</p>
<p>Wind Speed, wind Direction, wind Gust and wind Gust Direction	</p>
