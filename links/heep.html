  <p>  Data set description </p>
  
  <p>This data set is part of the project done by the <a href="http://www.branz.co.nz/cms_display.php"> BRANZ </a>group on New Zealand household energy use measurement and modelling. The focus of the project is given to the way that households consume the energy through the years of study. </p>
<p> The information can be obtained in a straightforward way. First the HEEP Energy and Temperature Data tool should be accessed from the link above. Then user will be required to select graph type and set the x axis and desired filters.
