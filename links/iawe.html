<p><h2>Access to the dataset </h2></p>

<p> Each individual channel of the data can be downloaded separately in either SQL or CSV format from: <a href="http://iawe.github.io/">http://iawe.github.io/</a>    </p>
  <p>  <h2>Data set description</h2> </p>
  
  
<p> iAWE data set contains whole  and sub-metered electricity, gas, and water  consumption data from a single house in Delhi, India.  The data have been captured during 73 days of the year, with one day fully labelled data. 33 sensors have been deployed through the house to collect relevant data.</p>
<p><h2> Dataset structure</h2></p>
<p>  From the repository an overview of the deployment of project is available. In which location of meters, metered devices and sensors are shown. Due to the frequent electricity outages in Delhi, as stated by project providers, a histogram of outage statistics is provided. Furthermore record of voltage fluctuation is presented.  The data are obtainable either selectively respecting to meters and sensors or in whole. 
A presentation  and paper on the project details including motivation behind it, building and measurement characteristics and unique features of the India grid is also available from the link.
