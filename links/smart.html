  <p> <h1> Data set description </h1> </p>
  <p> The Smart* data set composed of two datasets. They are UMass smart*  and UMass Smart* Microgrid .The UMass smart*  data set contains power data from three different smart homes.  The dataset includes electricity consumption and generation from wind turbine and solar panels with once measurement per second resolution. It also contains data of electricity usage at the circuit level with resolution of one measurement per a few seconds. The smart* dataset has ambient information and some ground truth data such as on/off events and opening/closing of the doors, as well. 
The UMass smart* Microgrid dataset contains whole building electricity usage of 443 anonymous homes in minute level and during 24 hours period of time. 
The repository of Smart* dataset also provides software tools that have been used in the project to collect the data.
 </p>
 <p> <h1>Dataset structure </h1>  </p>
 <p>The UMass smart* data set includes several compressed .tar files for each home. And each one of them contains several csv-Excel files for every day and a Format file describing the attributes name.  </p>
