  <p> <h2> Data set description </h2></p>
  This dataset is composed of the power consumption of 158 smart metered electrical appliances and no whole consumption (aggregated) data. This set contains 43 different types of appliances. 
  <p><h2> Dataset structure</h2></p>
  The data are grouped in three subsets of complete, incomplete and synthetic .zip files. Details of each one is given in a Readme.txt existing in the directory. Each group of data contains folders named by the appliances type, like printer, dishwasher, etc. then every folder contains consumption data in csv format.
