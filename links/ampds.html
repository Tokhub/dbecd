<p><h2>Access to the dataset </h2></p>
<p> The data set can be accessed from link below. In addition to the data set, good information about the details of the dataset, building and measurement equipment can be find in this
 <a href="http://ampds.org/">link </a>   . </p>
 
  <p>  Data set description </p>
  <p>The data AMPds data set contains electricity, water, and natural gas consumption data with minutely resolution. The data are captured from whole house consumption of electricity, gas and water. For electricity consumption data from individual sub circuits are captured as well. The measurements have been collected within two years. And the providers are going to continue capturing and publishing data in future. </p>
  
  <p><h2>Dataset structure</h2></p>
<p> The dataset comes in the form of a zip file containing several csv Excel files. Where, each file is named by the ID of the related circuits and appliance, for example DNE.csv refers to data from the Dining room plugs. The IDs are explained in a table that can be found at the above link. </p>
